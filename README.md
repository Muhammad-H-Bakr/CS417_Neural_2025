# CS417 Neural 2025

A coursework repository for **Neural Networks**.  
This repo explores core neural network concepts through Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains experiments, exercises, and notes to help understand the basics of **Neural Networks**.  
It focuses on understanding the network design, training, and evaluation through simple, hands-on examples and progress.

## ✅ Achieved Progress & Recap

- Completed initial setup and repository structure.
- A quick go-through for Python Basics. [Sec1]
- Learned the use of Jupyter Notebooks. (ipynb)
- Utilization of Numpy; Numerical Python. [Sec2]
- Understanding perceptrons, and working on their implementation for single and multilayer networks. [Sec3/Sec4]
- Training a Single Layer Preceptron using Delta rule. [Sec5]
- Utilization of Matplotlib to plot using preceptrons. [Sec5]
- Learning about different activation functions (sigmoid/tanh...) and error functions (MSE/...) [Sec6]
- Learning Backpropagation to train a multilayer network [Sec6]
- Learning How to use Tensorflow/Keras and Preprocess data using Pandas [Sec7/Sec8]
- Learning to design and implement a CNN [Mnist/Solo-effort]
- Final Project involving everything thus far integrated into CNN.

## 💡 Tools & Guides

- Install Python's Latest Version (Make sure it is installed as Env var for command line)
- Pycharm + Student license (Uni account); for those that don't have that: VSCode has good plugins that I will mention later.
- Anaconda and how to make a jupyter notebook in it. (as a last resort)
- Read about Python virtual environment (create, activate, deactivate, install packages). You will need it alot.
- Always refer to extensions from VSCode.
- Try to implement best practices on your own before refering to direct solution here.
- There "Preprocessing.md" file is basically a cheat sheet to make you always remember what to go with in terms of data preprocessing of csv and model building with keras (A useful extension is DataWrangler: to know the behavior of the data using pandas)
