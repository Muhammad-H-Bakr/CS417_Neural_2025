# CS417 Neural 2025

A coursework repository for **Neural Networks**.  
This repo explores core neural network concepts through Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains experiments, exercises, and notes to help understand the basics of **Neural Networks**.  
It focuses on understanding the network design, training, and evaluation through simple, hands-on examples and progress.

## 💡 Tools & Guides

- Install Python's Lates Version (Make sure it is installed as Env var for command line)
- Pycharm + Student license (Uni account); for those that don't have that: VSCode has good plugins that I will mention later.
- Anaconda and how to make a jupyter notebook in it. (as a last resort)
- Read about Python virtual environment (create, activate, deactivate, install packages). You will need it alot.
- (Stay Tuned for more)
