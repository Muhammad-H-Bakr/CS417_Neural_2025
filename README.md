## ðŸ’¡ Tools & Guides

- Install Python's Lates Version (Make sure it is installed as Env var for command line)
- Pycharm + Student license (Uni account); for those that don't have that: VSCode has good plugins that I will mention later.
- Anaconda and how to make a jupyter notebook in it. (as a last resort)
- Read about Python virtual environment (create, activate, deactivate, install packages). You will need it alot.
